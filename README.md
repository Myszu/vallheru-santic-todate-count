# vallheru-santic-todate-count
This script counts number of seconds, minutes, hours, days, months and years between initial date (today) and final date which is acquired by adding seconds  set in "add" variable. Be advised - this is not ready to use function. Just a solution to achieve some functions, which you have to create. Why I did it that way? Because for now I want to keep some functions exclusive for my game, but if U managed to fix existing bugs, then you shouldn't have any problems in extending its functionality. ;)
